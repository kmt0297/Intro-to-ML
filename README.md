# Intro-to-ML
STA S380: INTRO TO MACHINE LEARNING class project

Instructions for the project, from the professor, are as follows:

Your job is very simple: find an interesting prediction/classification problem and develop
the best possible predictions/classifications.
Your group will make a presentation to the class describing the problem and the steps
you took to arrive at your final solution (relevant data cleaning/transformation, models
and methods you implemented, how you tuned and evaluated them) and your findings
(measures of prediction/classification accuracy, descriptions of variable importance, etc)
